        # to access the website. For example, if the HSTS header is set to a
        # very long duration and the SSL/TLS certificate expires or is revoked,
        # legitimate users might be unable to access the website until
        # the HSTS header duration has expired.
        # The recommended value for the max-age is 2 year (63072000 seconds).
        # But we are using 1 hour (3600 seconds) for testing purposes
        # and ensure that the website is working properly before setting
        # to two years.
